gene_count_matrix.csv and  transcript_count_matrix.csv were generated using the script:
/seq/vgb/barkbase/scripts/prepDE.py

This script was provided by the creators of StringTie here:

I ran the script using the -l flag to pass in the read length of 101bp:

python prepDE.py -i sample_lst.txt -l 101

The list of sample names and the paths to their gtf files is here:
