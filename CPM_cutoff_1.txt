The TMM adjusted CPM values were created from the raw read counts
(/seq/vgb/barkbase/counts/raw_read_counts/) using edgeR using the
following commands:
__________________________________________________________________________
Gene-level:

use R-3.5
R
library(edgeR)
counts <-
read.delim("/seq/vgb/barkbase/counts/raw_read_counts/gene_count_matrix.csv",
row.names="gene_id",sep=",")

dge <- DGEList(counts=counts)

# Filtering step recommended in the edgeR users guide to keep only
# genes/transcripts expressed at > 1 CPM in at least 2 samples. 
# "We filter out lowly expressed genes using the following commands:
# Here, a CPM of 1 corresponds to a count of 6-7 in the smallest
# sample. A requirement for expression in two or more libraries is
# used as the minimum number of samples in each group is two. This
# ensures that a gene will be retained if it is only expressed in both
# samples in group 2. It is also recommended to recalculate the
# library sizes of the DGEList object after the filtering though the
# difference is usually negligible."

keep <- rowSums(cpm(dge)>1) >= 2
dge <- dge[keep, , keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]

# Calculate normalization factors

# Apply normalization factors to read counts
